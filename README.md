## Mnml
===============

This git repository contains a blog template called **Mnml**, which I've begun working on for a cool content editor called [Barley](http://www.getbarley.com/).

The site folder contains the template populated with placeholder data. The first post link works, which will take you to the post view showing basically what every element is styled like in the template.

The template folder contains the template, but rather than being populated with placeholder data, it's populated with the specified data from the [Barley template docs](http://plainmade.com/blog/5/draft-barley-template-documentation).
