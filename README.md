## Mnml
===============

This git repository contains a blog template called **Mnml**, which I've begun working on for a cool content editor called [Barley](http://www.getbarley.com/).

The template is populated with the specified data from the [Barley template docs](http://plainmade.com/blog/5/draft-barley-template-documentation). The Barley template documentation should be considered a working document until finalized by [Plain](http://plainmade.com).

There's also a live version with placeholder content available [here](http://ursa.ldwg.me/mnml/).
